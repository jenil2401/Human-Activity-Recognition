# Human-Activity-Recognition

A human activity recognition android application project is proposed using LSTM-RNN deep neural architecture. The network is able to read all six classes successfully and efficiently with only 50 epochs, achieving maximum accuracy. The work can also be
expanded with different data sources and
different classes. The model was successfully uploaded and uploaded to the
Android app and the TensorFlow library,
which enables you to make real-time
predictions. L2 regularization has already
been implemented to prevent overimmersion, but another solution would be
to add a stop, which is one of the most
effective and commonly used methods of
adapting to emotional networks to prevent
over-submitting models.
